## Directions

First, I used the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate my portfolio. 

* Created the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Used Bootstrap to create the following:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   
* Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.
* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
